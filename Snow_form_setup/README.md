### ServiceNow Sample App installation

This process is more thoroughly documented in the [ServiceNow documentation](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/washingtondc-application-development/page/build/applications/task/t_ImportAppFromSourceControl.html)

1. Login to ServiceNow as an Administrator
2. In ServiceNow - Launch Studio
3. Install the application code in Studio from [Service Now Account creation folder](./Snow_form_setup/servicenow-aws-account-creation ). Note, you may need to copy this folder to it's own git repository for ServiceNow to install the application. This is a copy of a sample application exported from a ServiceNow Personal Development Instance (PDI) used for testing.
4. You should now be able to leverage the AWS Account Creation form in ServiceNow
